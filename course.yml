title: NLP with Python
description: It is estimated that over 70% of potentially useable business information is unstructured, often in the form of text data. Text mining provides a collection of techniques that allow us to derive actionable insights from these data. In this course, we explore the basics of text mining using the bag of words method. The first three chapters introduce a variety of essential topics for analyzing and visualizing text data. Then, the final chapter allows you to apply everything you've learned in a real-world case study to extract insights from employee reviews of two major tech companies.
